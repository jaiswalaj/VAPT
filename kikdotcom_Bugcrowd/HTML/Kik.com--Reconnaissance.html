<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Reconnaissance</h1><br/>This is the first stage in the ethical hacking process. The white-hat hacker collects all the information available about the networks and systems in place, as well as the security measures that have been implemented. The ethical hacker has two types of reconnaissance that he can do in this phase. These are:<br /><br />    Active reconnaissance<br />    Passive reconnaissance<br /><br />Active reconnaissance is looking for information about the target network system, server, or application to increase the chances of the hacker being detected in the system. It is a lot riskier than the second type of reconnaissance, which is passive reconnaissance. Passive reconnaissance is the stealthier way of gaining information about the target. This is focused on information gathering about the companyâ€™s key members, essential facts about the company, finding out its IP addresses, and looking for other types of critical information about the company. <br /><br />Since most organizations have nearly all their information public, passively gathering information can be very easy for an ethical hacker.<br /></div>
